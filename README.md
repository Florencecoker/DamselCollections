# DamselCollections Music Recommender

The Damsel Collections Music Recommender is a Python-based project that provides music recommendations for users based on their preferences. It utilizes user ratings for different songs to generate personalized recommendations.

## Features

- Recommends music based on user ratings
- Provides a customizable number of recommendations
- Simple and easy-to-use interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas
   ```

4. Prepare your music data:

   - Create a CSV file containing the music data.
   - The CSV file should have the following columns:
     - `user_id`: User identifier
     - `song_id`: Song identifier
     - `rating`: User rating for the song (e.g., on a scale of 1-5)

5. Update the `data_file` variable in the code with the path to your music data file.

6. Run the program:

   ```shell
   python Damselcollectiond_music_recommender.py
   ```

7. Enter a user ID when prompted, and the program will generate a list of recommended song IDs based on the user's preferences.

## Customization

- If you have additional features or data that you want to incorporate into the recommender, you can modify the `DamselCollectionsMusicRecommender` class in the `DamselCollections_music_recommender.py` file accordingly.

- You can adjust the number of recommendations by changing the `num_recommendations` variable when calling the `recommend_music` method.
